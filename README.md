I specialize in developing flexible, distributed applications that seamlessly communicate with each other. I have extensive experience programming in Java, Kotlin, Go, TypeScript, and JavaScript. For data storage, I primarily work with MySQL and SQLite, but I’m also proficient in handling file-based databases like JSON and YAML.

In addition to software development, I’m well-versed in system administration and deployment tools such as Docker, Nginx, Redis, and Grafana. I have experience configuring and managing scalable infrastructure, ensuring applications run smoothly in production environments.
