My name is Alen and I'm a passionate programmer from Slovenia. I have 3 years of experience with Java and half a year of experience with Rust. I also have some experience with HTML, CSS, and LuaScript.

In addition to programming, I'm also skilled in system administration and have knowledge of how networks work. In my free time, I enjoy playing Minecraft.
